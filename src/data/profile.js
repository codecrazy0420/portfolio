  bio: [
    "I’m a Full-Stack Developer and AI/ML Engineer with over a decade of experience building fast, reliable, and scalable digital products.", 
    "My background spans everything from MERN, Python/Django, and PHP to designing cloud-ready backend architectures and modern, intuitive frontends.",
    "Alongside web development, I also work with Qt for cross-platform desktop apps and Arduino for embedded hardware projects—because I love bringing software and electronics together to solve real-world problems.",
    "In the last few years, I’ve leaned deeply into AI, creating LLM-powered features, RAG systems, automation tools, and intelligent user experiences that blend practical engineering with the next generation of technology. I’m focused on clean, maintainable code, thoughtful system design, and building solutions that are both technically strong and genuinely useful.", 
    "I enjoy challenging projects, learning fast, and delivering work that makes a measurable impact."
